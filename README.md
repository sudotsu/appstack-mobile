# Mastery Lab v2.0

## **Learn to Build Anything with AI in 4 Weeks**

Skip bootcamps. Skip months of tutorials. Learn just enough fundamentals to collaborate with AI and build like a senior dev.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

This isn't another coding tutorial. It's a **meta-learning system** where you:

1. **Build this exact app** while learning the concepts
2. **See how WE built it** (real conversation logs, design decisions)
3. **Customize it** with your own design and challenges
4. **Deploy YOUR version** to the Play Store

### Your Journey:

**Week 1-2: Foundation + Building**
- Just enough TypeScript, React, and Tailwind
- Learn by building real features
- Each challenge builds a piece of THIS app

**Week 3: Meta-Learning**
- "Here's how we built what you're using"
- AI collaboration strategies
- Real development workflow

**Week 4: Make It YOURS**
- Custom theme and branding
- Write challenges for YOUR niche
- Deploy YOUR product

**Week 5: Ship & Monetize**
- Deploy to Vercel (PWA)
- Build Android APK
- (Optional) Publish to Play Store

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: PWA Deployment (15 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel --prod

# Install on Android:
# 1. Open URL in Chrome on phone
# 2. Menu → "Install app"
# 3. Done!
```

### Option 2: Native Android APK (2-3 hours)

```bash
# 1. Build for export
npm run build

# 2. Add Android platform
npx cap add android

# 3. Sync assets
npx cap sync android

# 4. Build APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# APK will be at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
